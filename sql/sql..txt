database: is a system that allow users to store,organize and analyze data.
it is an organized collection  of data stored  in multiple related datasets 
example: employee database contains below datasets 
- employee dataset: id,name,age,department
department dept_id,dept_name,desc 
emmployee emp_id,emp_name,dob,salary,dept_id,loc_id 
location: loc_id,loc_name,desc 
sal_grade: grade,min_Sal,max_sal 
heierachy : emp_id,mngr_id 


uses of database:

what is RDBMS?
rdbms: relational data base management systems 
a relational database is database that stores data in a table form,containing columns and rows 
rdbms is a system used to store,manage,query and retrieve data stored in a relational databases 
the rdbms providers an interface between users and applications and the database

List of rdbms systems?
oracle,mysql,teradata,sql server,postegresql,vertica,
ibm db2,snowflake(cloud database)

what is table?

table is a database object that is a collection of related data entires,where data is organized in rows and columns 
rows are also knows as records 
columns are also knows as fields or attributes

example: customer table 
customer_id,customer_name,customer_age,customer_address,customer_phone
meta data: data about data,it gives the info that what data is stored in a table .

how to load data into database in tables?
using manual insert statements 
importing  data from files using sql clients(dbeaver,squirel,oracle sql dev,teradata sql assistant,toad)
load using etl tools or scripts 

how to access the data from database?
sql 
we can access and manipulate the data from relational databases by using sql 
sql is a programming language used to communicate with these rdbms systems like oracle,teradata,mysql,sql server etc ..
sql is an ansi/iso standard,all databases support ansi sql so the syntazes keywords and functions or almost similar in all databases 
we can build sql queries and procedures to opreate with the data present in database 
queries can be written by using oeprators,keywords ,expression functions..
sql is used for creating,modifying,querying,manipulating data in relational databases
queries can be written by using operators ,keywords expression functions 

datatypes 
datatypes are used to define the type of data that can be stored in a column of a table
data types specify the type of data we storing or querying 
there are many data types to store 
-- text (characters,strings)
--numeric values 
-- date and time values 
--boolean (true or false)
--images,audio,video data 

data types
1. numeric data types
--integer
--float
--decimal
--double precision
2. character data types
--character
--varchar
--char varying
--text
--clob
3. date and time data types
--date
--time
--timestamp
--datetime
4. boolean data types
--boolean
5. binary data types
--binary
--varbinary
--blob
--bytea
6. other data types
--array
--json
--xml
--uuid
--geometry

what is difference char and varchar?
char is fixed length character data type
varchar is variable length character data type
char(5) means it will always occupy 5 bytes of space even if we store less than
varchar(5) means it will occupy only the space required to store the data

what is difference between int,integer,bigint?
int and integer are same
int is used in sql server
integer is used in oracle,mysql,postgresql
bigint is used to store larger integer values
what are the data types? 
date it is used to specify date format yyy-mm-dd 
time: it is used to specify the format. its format is hh:mm:ss or hh24:ml:ss 
datatime: it is used to specify date and time combination .
it is format is yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss 
timestamp: it is used to specify the timestamp 
boolean : just to indicate true or false,0 is false any non-zero is true 

operators in sql 
1. arithmetic operators
2. comparison operators
3. logical operators
4. string operators
5. bitwise operators
6. assignment operators
7. special operators
--arithmetic operators
+, -, *, /, %   
--comparison operators
=, <>, !=, >, <, >=, <=
--logical operators
and, or, not
--string operators
+, ||
--bitwise operators
&,&,&,^,~
--assignment operators
=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, ^=, &=, |=, <<=,
--special operators
like, ilike, in, not in, exists, not exists, is null, is not
is distinct from, is not distinct from

sql set operators with examples 
1. union: it is used to combine the result of two or more select statements
each select statement within union must have the same number of columns
the columns must have similar data types
also, the columns in each select statement must be in the same order
example: select * from table1 union select * from table2
2. union all: it is used to combine the result of two or more select statements
it returns all rows including duplicates
example: select * from table1 union all select * from table2
3. intersect: it is used to return only the rows that are common to the result of two
or more select statements
example: select * from table1 intersect select * from table2
4. except: it is used to return only the rows that are present in the first select
statement but not in the second select statement
example: select * from table1 except select * from table2

types of sql statements ?

there are 5 types of sql statements 
ddl: data definition language 
dml: data manipulation language 
dcl: data control language 
tcl: transaction control language 
dql: data query language 

types of sql statements 
sql commands 
ddl :create alter drop truncate 
dml: insert update delete 
dcl: grant revoke 
tcl: commit rollback revoke 
dql: select 

ddl definition?
ddl stands for data definition language
deals with the definition of database objects,used to create ,modify 
and remove the structure of the database objects like tables, views,functions etc. 
below are the ddl commands 
create,alter,drop,truncate...


ddl is used to define the structure of a database
ddl commands are used to create modify and delete database objects such as tables indexes views and relationships
ddl commands are used to define the structure of a database

create command?
create command is used to create a new database object such as table,view,index,stored procedure etc
syntax:
create TABLE TAB_NAME
{
    column1 datatype,
    column2 datatype,
    ...
};
crete view view_name as select _ from tab_name;

alter command?
alter command is used to modify the structure of an existing database object
alter used to alter the structure of table like adding new columns, dropping existing 
column,changing the length or datatype of a column and to rename the table?

syntax :
alter TABLE TAB_NAME
{
    ADD column_name datatype,
    DROP COLUMN column_name,
    MODIFY COLUMN column_name datatype
};

drop : used to drop database objects like tables, views ,functions ,procedures,indexes etc 

syntax: 
    drop table table_name; or drop table_name;
    drop view view_name;
    drop function fun_name;
    drop index index_name;

truncate : it deletes all rows from the table and we can't rollback the deleted records 

syntax: 
    truncate table table_name;


ddl command practice 

create database query?

create database if not exists emp;

use database ?
use emp;

create table ?
create table employee(
employee_id bigint,
first_name varchar(20),
last_name varchar(25),
hire_date DATE,
salary integer,
manager_id bigint ,
department_id int

);
# table ddl employee ddl  above query 
# create database 

create database if not exists emp;
# select database 
use emp;
# create table 
create table public.employee
(
employee_id bigint,
first_name varchar(20),
last_name varchar(20),
hire_date date,
salary integer,
manager_id bigint,
department_id int 
);

desc table employee;
--renaming table using alter--


alter table public.employee rename to public.employees;

--add a new column 'location'--
alter table public.employee add column location varchar(30);

desc table employee;
-- increase the length of first_name from 20 to 25 -- 
alter table public.employee modify FIRST_NAME varchar(25);

DESC TABLE EMPLOYEE;

--DROP EXISTING COLUMN MANAGER_ID -- 
alter table public.employee drop column MANAGER_ID;

--DESCRIBE TABLE --
DESC TABLE EMPLOYEE;

--DROP THE TABLE COMPLETELY--
DROP TABLE PUBLIC.EMPLOYEES;

SHOW TABLES;

dml commands?
dml :dml statements are used to add the data,modify data and to delete the data from tables.

below are the dml commands :
--insert 
--update 
--delete 


insert: to insert data into table,by using insert we can 

insert single record manually 
insert multiple records manually 
insert bulk data from other processes 
insert data from one table to another data 

syntax: 
insert into table_name(columns)
values(....);
insert into table_a(columns) select from table_b;
--insert single record manually--

Update:
 Update: to modify data from the table. we use set keyword for updating data 
 by using update we can 
 1. update one or more columns data 
 2. update one or more records based on condition 
 3. update entire table 

syntax: update table table_name set column1=,column2=..,

update table table_name set column1=...
where condition;
--update single record--
update employee set salary=50000 where employee_id=1;
--update multiple records--
update employee set salary=50000 where department_id=1;
--update entire table--
update employee set salary=50000;

delete :

delete: to remove records from table, by using delete we can 
1. delete one or more record based on condition 
2.delete all records 

syntax: delete from table_name;
    delete from table_name where condition;

what is difference between truncate and delete?
we can delete one or more or all records from a table by using delete statement based on conditions and we can rollback the deleted data if we need .
delete is a dml statement.
truncate will delete all the records and the delete data can't be rolled back.
it is a ddl statement.
it will reset the identity column to its seed value.
it is faster than delete statement.

TCL(transaction control language)
tcl: a transaction is a set if sql statements executed on the data stored in database/
tcl commands are used to manage those transaction in the database and mainly to control the transaction made by dml commands like insert,update and delete .

commit 
rollback
savepoint
commit: to save the changes made by dml commands in the database.
it is used to permanently save any transaction into the database 
syntax: commit;

rollback: to undo the changes made by dml commands in the database.
it is used to rollback the transaction made after last commit 
syntax: rollback;

savepoint: it is used to save transaction up to a point and we can rollback the transaction made after that point 
save transaction sp1;
transactions..
rollback transaction sp2;


dcl (data control language)
dcl : dcl commands are used to handle access provileage for users and roles on database objects to.
only database administrator's & owner's of the database objects to users and roles 
grant: it is used to provide permissions on database objects to users and roles 
syntax: GRANT  prviliage_name on db_object TO user |role 
revoke: it is used to remove permissions on database objects to users and roles 
syntax: revoke prviliage_name on db_object from user|role 


previlege : privilege let the user know what are all operations that users can perform on that object 
table/view privileges: select,insert,update,delete and all 
schema/database level previlege create,alter and drop

DQL (data query language) 
dql: 
select is the only dql commadn we use to retrieve data from database 
select is the very impt command that we use to fetch data from tables and views 
select command plays key role in data analysis
syntax: select * /column_list from table/view_name;

select * from public.employee;
select * from public.employee where department_id=91;


select statement:
 select : select command is used to retreive data from tables and views in database 
 syntax: select * /column_list from table/view_name;

 with select statements we can 

 -- fetch all columns(*) or only required columns from a table 
 ---- fetch all records or subset of records using where filter condition 
 --evaluate expression
 --call pre-defined functions and user defined functions 
 --calculate aggregation and summers 
 --order data in ascending or descending order 



----select---

---display all columns and all records from table--
select * from public.employee;

--display all columns and all records from table--
select first_name,last_name from public.employee;

--calcualte yearly salary for all employees--
select employee_id,first_name,salary as year_salary ,salary*12 from employee;


---derive full name-- 
select first_name ,last_name ,first_name||last_name as full_name from public.employee;

select first_name,last_name,first_name||' '||last_name as full_name from public.employee;

--perform airthemetic operations--
select 20+47,277+48,-146+26;

--call predefined functions--
select sqrt(625),power(4,3),mod(92,10);

--other database try with dual dummay --
select 20+45,278+149,sqrt(625),power(4,3),mod(92,10) from dual;

select 20+48,278+45,-146-24,power(4,5),mod(92,10) from dummy;
